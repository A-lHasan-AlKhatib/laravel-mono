# Laravel Mono

This repository contains a trio of small Laravel applications that were built while learning the framework.
Each project is selfâ€‘contained in its own directory and can be run independently.

## Projects

### api-project
A simple REST API secured with Sanctum tokens. It provides user registration and authentication plus endpoints for posts, comments and likes.

### handy-app
A tutorial job board that demonstrates Laravel fundamentals such as CRUD, queues and user sessions.

### pixel-positions
Another job board experiment that adds tagging and search functionality to the basic listings.

See the README inside each project folder for setup instructions and further details.
